## Running main.py
### Folder structure
To run the main.py file the only other things needed are a trained model and a video to process. The application as is will generate two folders in the directory the main.py file is run from, output, and model. These folders are the default directories for the detection model, and the default output file location. 
The typical folder structure where the main.py is located will appear as below.

### Execution arguments
There are two ways to execute the python script, one is to directly execute the file from the command line with the following command. 
```shell
python main.py
```
 The above will run the python file and generate the GUI to set parameters. The second way to execute the python file is with full arguments in the command line.
```shell
python main.py <path to video> <path to output> <one of .csv, .json, .xml, .xlsx>
```
or
```shell
python main.py C:\users\public\videos\testing.mp4 C:\users\public\videos .csv
```

### Output
The main.py will generate three files, an output of the video passed in with visuals of the detections process drawn in incase of unexpected data being shown in the output data file. The output data file will be named the same as the input file (i.e 2022-03-21-linefishing.mp4 -> 2022-03-21-linefishing.csv) in the defined output folder. The last file generated by main.py on execution is a log file named 'output_\<Month>-\<Day>-\<Hour>-\<Minute>.log' in the same directory as main.py.
